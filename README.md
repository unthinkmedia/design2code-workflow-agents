# Design-to-Code Workflow Agents

A comprehensive AI agent workflow system that transforms visual designs into production-ready React components using BaseUI design system principles. This system provides a complete end-to-end pipeline from design analysis to fully functional code implementation.

## 🎯 Overview

This workflow system consists of four specialized AI agents that work together to convert designs into code:

1. **UI Analysis Agent** - Analyzes screenshots and Figma designs using Atomic Design methodology
2. **Design Token Strategist** - Creates comprehensive design token systems with light/dark mode support
3. **BaseUI Component Builder** - Generates production-ready React components using BaseUI primitives
4. **Layout Implementation Agent** - Converts visual designs to pixel-perfect implementations with automated testing

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- VS Code with AI assistant support (GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.)
- Node.js environment for React development
- Figma account (optional, for enhanced design analysis)
- Playwright for automated testing (optional)

### Basic Workflow

1. **Start with Design Analysis** - Use the UI Analysis Agent to break down your design
2. **Create Design Tokens** - Generate systematic design tokens for consistency
3. **Build Components** - Create reusable React components with BaseUI
4. **Implement Layout** - Convert to pixel-perfect implementations

    <role>Specific function in one sentence</role>
    <mission>Primary outcome for users</mission>
    <expertise>Concrete domains and skills</expertise>
</agent_identity>
```

**Step 3: Establish Core Objectives**
Use hierarchical objectives to resolve conflicts:
```markdown
<core_objectives>
    <primary_objective>Most important goal (non-negotiable)</primary_objective>
    <secondary_objectives>
        <objective>Important but can be compromised</objective>
        <objective>Enhancement that adds value</objective>
    </secondary_objectives>
    <success_criteria>Measurable outcomes</success_criteria>

Be explicit about what the agent can and cannot do:
```markdown
<capabilities_and_limitations>
    <core_capabilities>
        <capability>Specific capability with clear scope</capability>
    </core_capabilities>
    
    <explicit_limitations>
        <limitation>Clear boundary with explanation</limitation>
    </explicit_limitations>
    
    <boundary_handling>
        <approach>How to handle edge cases</approach>
        <escalation>When and how to escalate</escalation>
    </boundary_handling>
</capabilities_and_limitations>
```

**Step 6: Create Workflow Standards**
Define step-by-step processes and quality gates:
```markdown
<workflow_standards>
    <standard_process>
        <step_1>First action with clear objective</step_1>
        <step_2>Second action building on step 1</step_2>
        <!-- Continue with logical progression -->
    </standard_process>
    
    <quality_assurance>
