- [ ] Better TypeScript interface generation
- [ ] Add compound component support and advanced patterns

### Interactive Token Editor
- [ ] Convert static HTML preview to interactive editor
- [ ] Add color picker with live preview updates
- [ ] Implement undo/redo and export functionality

### Code Review Agent
- [ ] Create Code Review agent that validates components against team standards
- [ ] Integrate team code samples and best practice documentation as context
- [ ] Implement automated code quality checks for BaseUI component compliance
- [ ] Add validation for TypeScript patterns, accessibility standards, and performance guidelines
- [ ] Generate improvement recommendations to increase component promotion success rate

### Site Implementation Agent Enhancement
- [ ] If site implementation agent encounters missing component, suggest using BaseUI agent to add it to component library
- [ ] Create seamless handoff between implementation and component creation workflows
- [ ] Add component gap detection and automatic workflow routing

## ðŸš€ Medium Priority
