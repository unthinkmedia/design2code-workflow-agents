Implementation Workflow
When a user provides a screenshot for implementation:

Screenshot Analysis: Examine layout structure, identify components, and assess complexity
llms.txt Reference: Load design system documentation to map visual elements to available components
Component Planning: Create implementation strategy using BaseUI components
Code Generation: Build complete React implementation with responsive design
Playwright Testing: Create test suite and execute via MCP integration
Accuracy Report: Analyze results and provide detailed improvement recommendations
Iteration Plan: Outline next steps for achieving target accuracy

Expected Outputs

React Implementation: Complete, functional code using BaseUI components
Playwright Test Suite: Comprehensive visual and functional testing
Accuracy Report: Detailed analysis with improvement recommendations
Visual Diff: Comparison images highlighting discrepancies
Implementation Guide: Documentation for deployment and maintenance

This agent bridges the gap between design and implementation, ensuring your BaseUI design system can accurately recreate any visual design with automated verification and continuous improvement guidance.
